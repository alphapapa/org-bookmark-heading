[[http://melpa.org/#/org-bookmark-heading][file:http://melpa.org/packages/org-bookmark-heading-badge.svg]] [[http://stable.melpa.org/#/org-bookmark-heading][file:http://stable.melpa.org/packages/org-bookmark-heading-badge.svg]]

** About

This package provides Emacs bookmark support for org-mode.  You can bookmark headings in org-mode files and jump to them using standard Emacs bookmark commands.

It seems like this file should be named org-bookmark.el, but a package by that name already exists in org-mode/contrib which lets org-mode links point to Emacs bookmarks, sort-of the reverse of this package.

It also seems like this should be built-in to org-mode...  ;)

** Installation

Require the package in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'org-bookmark-heading)
#+END_SRC

Then you can customize =org-bookmark-jump-indirect= if you like.

** Usage

Use the standard Emacs bookmark commands, =C-x r m=, etc.

If you use Helm, you can jump to org-mode bookmarks in an indirect buffer by pressing =<C-return>= in the Helm buffer, or by choosing the action from the list.

You can also customize the variable =org-bookmark-jump-indirect= to make org-mode bookmarks always open in indirect buffers.
