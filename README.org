This library provides Emacs bookmark support for Org mode.  You can bookmark headings in Org files and jump to them using standard Emacs bookmark commands.

It seems like this package should be named ~org-bookmark~, but a package by that name already exists in ~org-mode/contrib~ which lets Org links point to Emacs bookmarks.

It also seems like this should be built-in to Org.  Someday it may be upstreamed...

* Installation

If you've installed from MELPA (or with a package system like Straight or Quelpa), you're done.  Then you can customize =org-bookmark-jump-indirect= if you like.

To install manually, put ~org-bookmark-heading.el~ in your ~load-path~ and require the feature in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'org-bookmark-heading)
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Use the standard Emacs bookmark commands, =C-x r m=, etc.

If you use Helm, you can jump to Org bookmarks in an indirect buffer by pressing =<C-return>= in the Helm buffer, or by choosing the action from the list.

You can also customize the variable =org-bookmark-jump-indirect= to make Org bookmarks always open in indirect buffers.

* Changelog

** 1.3.2

*Compatibility*
+ Require Emacs 25.1 or later (this appears to have been necessary for a while, so making it official is belated but correct).
+ Depend on ~compat~ package.

*Fixes*
+ Call ~org-bookmark-heading-after-jump-hook~ every time (instead of only when using indirect buffers).  ([[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-bookmark-heading/issues/30][#30]].  Thanks to [[https://github.com/schwurg][Tim Wichmann]].)

** 1.3.1

*Fixes*
+ Option ~org-bookmark-heading-make-ids~ when bookmarking an indirect buffer with option set to =Make ID if missing and entry is within `org-directory'=.

** 1.3

*Additions*
+ Option ~org-bookmark-heading-after-jump-hook~ is called after jumping to a bookmark.  It can be used to, e.g. cycle visibility.

*Fixes*
