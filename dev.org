** TODO Fill in bookmark name in helm-bookmarks

When creating a bookmark with =helm-bookmarks=, the bookmark name doesn't get filled in like it does when using =C-x r m=.

** DONE Make changes [[gnus:gmane.emacs.orgmode#87wpi3imbl.fsf@nicolasgoaziou.fr][suggested by Nicolas]]
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-10-22 Sat 09:15]
